            <p>Harry Potter's life is miserable. His parents are dead and<br>
            he's stuck with his heartless relatives, who force him to<br>
            live in a tiny closet under the stairs. But his fortune<br>
            changes when he receives a letter that tells him the truth<br>
            about himself: he's a wizard. A mysterious visitor rescues<br>
            him from his relatives and takes him to his new home,<br>
            Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. After a<br>
            lifetime of bottling up his magical powers, Harry finally<br>
            feels like a normal kid.</p>
