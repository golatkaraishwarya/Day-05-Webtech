            <p>The 3 Mistakes of my life is the third novel written by<br>
            eminent Indian Author Chetan Bhagat. Based on cricket,<br>
            business and religion, the novel is set against the<br>
            backdrop of beautiful city Ahmedabad. Revolving around<br>
            three young Indian boys Omi, Ishaan and Govind, the<br>
            book goes on to narrate how the three are trying their<br>
            best to make ends meet in the city. Based on real events,<br>
            the book starts with a dramatic twist, where Bhagat is<br>
            reading an e-mail sent by some young person Govind.</p>
